[[CV]](/files/CV_Guangyang_Zeng.pdf)

I received the B.Eng. degree in automation and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2017 and 2022. Now I am a Postdoctoral Fellow (Advisor: [Prof. Haizhou Li](https://colips.org/~eleliha/), [Prof. Jiahu Qin](https://iat.ustc.edu.cn/iat/x165/20210523/4725.html), [Prof. Junfeng Wu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/junfengwu/)) at the School of Data Science, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China. My research interests include statistical inference, state estimation, and wireless sensor networks.
